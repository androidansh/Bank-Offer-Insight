# Bank Offer Insights Dashboard

Welcome to the **Bank Offer Insights Dashboard** project! This repository showcases an interactive Power BI dashboard designed to deliver actionable insights for targeted bank offersâ€”ranging from credit cards to fixed deposits (FDs) and loan products. This project highlights my data analysis, visualization, and business intelligence skills.

## Overview

In this project, I analyzed customer spending and income data from a financial institution to derive insights that help the bank tailor its product offers. The dashboard is divided into sections addressing different product lines:

- **Credit Card Offers:** Analyzing average spend per category, city, occupation, and monthly spending trends.
- **FD & Loan Offers:** Focusing on high-income segmentation, debt-to-income ratios (DTI), and average spend per age group to identify ideal customers for investment and lending products.

The objective is to empower the bank with data-driven decision-making to enhance customer targeting and optimize product offerings.

## Data Description

The project uses two main datasets:

- **Customer Spending Data (`cust_spend`):**  
  Contains transaction-level details such as `customer_id`, `month`, `category`, `payment_type`, and `spend`.

- **Customer Details (`cust_details`):**  
  Includes demographic and financial information such as `customer_id`, `age_group`, `city`, `occupation`, `gender`, `marital_status`, and `avg_income`.

These datasets were merged on `customer_id` to compute key metrics like total spend per customer, average spend per category, and income utilization ratios.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preparation & Integration**  
   - **Cleaning & Merging:** The data was cleansed (handling missing values and duplicates) and merged using `customer_id` as the key.
   - **Metric Calculation:** Key metrics such as total spend, average spend, and growth rates were computed using Python (Pandas) and DAX in Power BI.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Initial analysis was performed using Python to understand trends and validate assumptions.
   - Basic visualizations were created to identify patterns across spending categories, cities, age groups, and more.

3. **Interactive Dashboard Creation in Power BI**  
   - **Calculated Columns & Measures:** DAX formulas were used to derive KPIs like spending growth rate, income utilization, and DTI.
   - **Slicers & Filters:** Interactive filters (e.g., by location, age group, occupation) allow users to drill down into specific segments.

## Dashboard Highlights

### Insights for Credit Card Offers
- **Avg Spend Per Category:**  
  Visualizes customer spending across categories like Travel, Groceries, Electronics, and Apparel.
  
- **Avg Spend Per City & Occupation:**  
  Displays spending variations across major cities (e.g., Mumbai, Delhi NCR, Bengaluru) and across different occupations.
  
- **Spending Growth Rate:**  
  Tracks month-over-month spending growth, enabling targeted credit card rewards or cashback offers.
  
- **Income Utilisation by Payment Type:**  
  Analyzes how different payment methods (UPI, Debit Card, Credit Card) are used.

### Insights for Loans and FD Offers
- **High-Income Segmentation:**  
  Identifies high-income customers (using data-driven thresholds) who are ideal candidates for FD investments.
  
- **Debt-to-Income (DTI) Analysis:**  
  Evaluates DTI ratios across age groups and months to pinpoint customers who may benefit from loan products.
  
- **Avg Spend per Age Group:**  
  Supports segmentation by revealing spending behaviors across various age cohorts.

## Key Insights

- **Targeted Product Offering:**  
  - Customers with higher average spend and robust income profiles are ideal for premium credit card and FD offers.  
  - A rising spending trend and high credit card utilization indicate potential for personalized loan products.

- **Regional Differences:**  
  - Cities like Mumbai and Delhi NCR exhibit higher average spends, suggesting a stronger market for high-end financial products.  
  - Location-based insights allow the bank to tailor offers to regional market conditions.

- **Customer Segmentation:**  
  - Age and occupation play critical roles: while younger groups may favor loan products (for education, vehicles, etc.), older segments tend to prefer secure investment options like FDs.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Python:**  
  Data cleaning, processing, and initial exploratory analysis (using Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib/Seaborn).

- **Power BI:**  
  Creating interactive dashboards and visualizations; using DAX for calculated columns and measures.

- **DAX:**  
  Custom formulas to compute KPIs such as spending growth rate, income utilization, and DTI.
